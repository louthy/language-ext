/// <remarks>
/// `K〈F, A〉` should be thought of as `F〈A〉` (where both `F` an `A` are parametric).  It currently
/// can't be represented in C#, so this allows us to define higher-kinded types and pass them
/// around.  We can then build traits that expected a `K` where the trait is tied to the `F`.
///
/// For example:
///
///     K〈F, A〉 where F : Functor〈F〉
///     K〈M, A〉 where M : Monad〈M〉
///
/// That means we can write generic functions that work with monads, functors, etc.
/// </remarks>
