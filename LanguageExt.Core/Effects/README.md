Effects are functorial, monadic, and applicative types that are designed to capture IO based side-effects.    

| Section              | Type                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [`IO`](IO)           | [`IO<A>`](IO)                                 | Asynchronous and synchronous IO.  Captures side-effects, manages resources, but throws exceptions.  The `IO` monad is the base of all IO based operations and should be used in your monad-transformer stacks when you need IO. |
| [`Eff`](Eff)         | [`Eff<A>`](Eff)                               | Asynchronous and synchronous IO.  Captures side-effects, manages resources, handles exceptions elegantly.                                                                                                                       |
| [`Eff`](Eff)         | [`Eff<RT, A>`](Eff)                           | Asynchronous and synchronous IO.  Captures side-effects, manages resources, handles exceptions elegantly, and has an injectable runtime (`RT`) which can provide configuration and dependency-injection                         |
